    "ProjectIdea": [
        "**FTP Client** ```(suggested implementation: web, desktop or CLI app)```.\n Build a simple FTP client. As a bonus challenge, support secure file transfer.",
        "**HTTP Server** ```(suggested implementation: any programming language you want to master)```.\n To understand HTTP deeply, build an HTTP server. There are a number of tutorials available to guide you through the process.",
        "**Build a simple operating system** ```(suggested implementation: any programming language you want to master)```.\n This is a project that is technically challenging and will deepen your understanding of how computers and operating systems work.",
        "**Build a web scraper** ```(suggested implementation: any programming language you want to master)```.\n Build a tool that takes a URL as input and returns the content of the URL as HTML or XML.",
        "**Bandwidth monitor** ```(suggested implementation: live updating CLI tool)```.\n Build a tool to track how much data you have downloaded or uploaded on the internet. Have it email you a weekly report of your usage. As a bonus challenge, predict peak usage times.",
        "**A random name generator** ```(suggested implementation: CLI, web, or mobile app)```.\n Build a random name generator (example) that creates unique names on the fly, based on an algorithm. Use machine learning techniques to help you by training the program with a sample data set of names similar to those you want to generate. Otherwise, create your own lexical rules for how names are generated",
        "**Interactive fiction** ```(suggested implementation: CLI)```.\n A fun way to get into game development without having to worry about graphical assets, interactive fiction renders the world for the player through text descriptions. The Dreamhold is a good example of interactive fiction with a useful ‘help’ command.",
        "**An unbeatable Tic-Tac-Toe engine** ```(suggested implementation: CLI program)```.\n For an excellent first AI project, try to write an engine that cannot be beaten at Tic-Tac-Toe. You can achieve this by implementing this strategy, which produces a draw as its worst-case outcome",
        "**A chess engine** ```(suggested implementation: an engine written in a programming language you want to learn, or master)```.\n Try to write an engine that can play chess against a human opponent using a Universal Chess Interface compatible GUI, such as XBoard. See Stockfish as an example. For a less daunting challenge, you may wish to focus on the behavior of just one piece, e.g., Knights.",
        "**A niche chatbot** ```(suggested implementation: web app)```.\n Some of the greatest minds in the world are working on chatbots that respond in lifelike ways. It’s an incredibly difficult challenge, but, by reducing the scope of your chatbot, you have a side project that is more approachable for evenings and weekends. Create a chatbot that produces real-sounding responses based on a niche topic that you’re passionate about: your favorite band, video game, sports team, or TV show.",
        "**A spam classifier** ```(suggested implementation: any programming language you want to master)```.\n Build a tool to classify whether an email is or isn’t spam based on the content alone. You can use this public data set of emails from the Enron investigation to test your spam classifier.",
        "**A movie showtime finder** ```(suggested implementation: web or mobile app with email or text message notifications)```.\n Build a program that notifies you, by text or email, about showtimes for potentially interesting movies playing at your favorite cinema. The concept of an 'interesting movie' can be derived using machine learning (if you watch enough movies to have good training data), or a handcrafted algorithm. For example, you might use the Open Movie Database API, paired with an HTML parser like BeautifulSoup, to build a program that alerts you to sci-fi movies rated 7.0 or above on IMDB, movies starring Amy Adams, and/or any movie with an average rating of 8.0 or higher.",
        "**A spoiler blocker** ```(suggested implementation: browser extension)```.\n Short of implementing a total social media/internet/watercooler chat ban, it can be difficult to avoid seeing spoilers for your favorite TV show… especially if that TV show is as popular as Game of Thrones. Create a browser extension that removes all mentions of your favorite show from any webpage loaded in your browser… or replaces them with cute pictures of puppies."

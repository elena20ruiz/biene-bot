        "We are so proud for confirming that yes, there are a lot of Hardware! :robot_face:"

    "Help": [
        "I can tell you about how to request hardware or which available hardware we have just asking me about this :blush:"
    ],
    "How": [
        "On your MyHackUPC (https://my.hackupc.com) you can request as many hardware articles as you need for your project. In that page you can find a list of the hardware available. Once requested, the hardware is reserved for you for a certain amount of time. Before the time's up, you can go to the Hardware Lab desk (same location as InfoDesk or Baggage Check-in) to retrieve the item. To retrieve the item you'll have to leave an ID in the desk, so don't forget to take it with you! :smile:"
